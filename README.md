# 📌 PinIt – Save and Organize Tabs

PinIt is a simple **tab organizer web app** that helps you save, categorize, and manage your frequently used websites.  
It uses **localStorage** to persist your saved links, so your tabs stay organized even after refreshing or reopening the page.

- 📂 Categorize tabs into groups:
  - Study
  - Entertainment
  - Socials
  - Tools
  - Others
- 🌐 Each tab displays the **website favicon** automatically.
- 🗑️ Remove tabs with a single click.
- 💾 Tabs are stored in **localStorage** for persistence.
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop & mobile.
